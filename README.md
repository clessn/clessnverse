Welcome to the CLESSN's package where all our functions are "supposedly" stored. The package is still under construction. Therefore, it is important to make sure to use the right **branch**. You are now on the master branch, which is the last working version of the package. If you want to access newer functions, you may go look at **branch v2**. Here's how :

### On GitHub

1. See the `master` button a bit up left, right under the `<> Code` button? Click on it.
2. You are now able to switch from branch to branch on **GitHub**.
3. This allows you to **look** at the code and copy paste what you want. 
4. There are interesting information in V2's readMe

### On your terminal

1. After cloning the repository, you'll see the master branch on your computer. 
2. To change branches, it easy, just do :
    - `git branch` to see where you are
    - `git checkout name-of-branch` to switch to the right branch
3. Now you can contribute to V2, but **PLEASE** read its readMe before. Otherwise I'll cut you.
4. Seriously, check out number 3.
